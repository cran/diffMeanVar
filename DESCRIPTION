Description: A collection of functions to detect gene probes with different means or variances between two groups in (epi)-genomic data analysis, including classical F test and Levene's test for equal variance, likelihood ratio test for equal mean and equal variance, the wrappers for functions in R Bioconductor package 'missMethyl' (Phipson and Oshlack (2014) <doi:10.1186/s13059-014-0465-4>), the implementation of the methods proposed by Ahn and Wang (2013) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3621641/>, and the improved Ahn and Wang's methods that we proposed recently (Qiu and Li et al. (2017) <http://oprscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/new-score-tests-for-equality-of-variances-in-the-application-of-dna-methylation-data-analysis.pdf>).
